# Self-Driving Cars Specialization - University of Toronto

This repository contains my lab implementations from the **Self-Driving Cars Specialization** by the University of Toronto.  
The labs cover key concepts in autonomous driving, including **computer vision, sensor fusion, localization, planning, and control**.
